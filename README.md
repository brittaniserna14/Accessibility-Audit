The job from this client required a refactoring that enabled the Horiseon website to be updated to HTML5 Semantic tags and elements and to add alt text across the page to be more accesible to those who are visuall impaired. 

The css style sheet also had to be updated to reflect a more consolidated cleaner look with descriptive notes. the end result is what is included in the final product.
